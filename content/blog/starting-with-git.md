Recently I started using [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) again so I could play with [Kohana v3](http://kohanaframework.org/) (it has a tutorial about [Working with Git](http://kohanaframework.org/guide/tutorials.git)). Here are some really neat resources which I'm pretty sure are already popular (just wanted to repost them like what everybody does):

* [External Links of Git in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)#External_links)
* [Github Help](http://help.github.com/)
* #git in [Freenode](http://freenode.net/)

The first two pages provide even more useful links. If you use [SVN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) then you might find [this link](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html) useful.

I am only familiar with two web hosting service that uses [Git](http://git-scm.com/) namely:

* [Codaset](http://codaset.com/) (which just recently launched); and
* [Github](http://github.com) (which I believe is the popular one)

I am currently using Codaset for trying out Git.

A common and quick step-by-step guide for Git follows:

1. git init
2. touch README.
3. git add README.md
4. git commit -m "Added readme file..."
5. git remote add origin &lt;url&gt;
6. git push origin master

git++! Cheers! :bigsmile:
