I was recently searching for a [CSS Framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework#CSS_framework). Amongst the ones I found that I believe are popular were [Blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/), [960gs](http://960.gs/), and [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/). I also searched from the [Kohana forums](http://forum.kohanaframework.org/comments.php?DiscussionID=1691&Focus=12021) since I was planning to use the CSS framework on trying out [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) and found [BlueTrip](http://bluetrip.org/). Looked really nice and was quite easy to use (check out its [documentation](http://bluetrip.org/docs/quick-start-guide) :D) although I haven't much explored it.

BlueTrip's definition taken directly from its site:

> A full featured and beautiful CSS framework which originally combined the best of Blueprint, Tripoli (hence the name), Hartija, 960.gs, and Elements, but has now found a life of its own.

And its __Feature List__:

* 24-column grid
* Sensible typography styles
* Clean form styles
* A print stylesheet
* An empty starter stylesheet
* Sexy buttons
* Status message styles

Nice! 8)
