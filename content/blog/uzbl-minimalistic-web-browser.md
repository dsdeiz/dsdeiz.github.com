[Uzbl](http://www.uzbl.org/) is a very nice browser &mdash; quite easy to use, navigation is through keybinds, has modes, and a lot more features. Uzbl can be taken [here](http://uzbl.org/get.php).

A brief description of Uzbl taken directly from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbl):

>Uzbl is a free and open source minimalistic web browser designed for simplicity and adherence to the Unix philosophy. Development started in early 2009 and is still considered in alpha software by the developers. The core component of uzbl is developed in C but other languages are also used, most notably Python. All parts of the uzbl project is released as free software under the GNU General Public License (GPL, version 3).

>The name comes from the word usable, that is spelled in lolspeak.
