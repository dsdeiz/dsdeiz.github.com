    <p>Recently, I encountered a project that requires rebuilding a site over and over in order to test recent changes. There were a bunch of scripts that did this automatically.

The PHP scripts task were to import content, terms, and probably set some configurations. These PHP scripts are also the ones ran through drush scr.

For adding the #process callback, you can do it like this:

    <p>I recently just started studying about Drupal's Batch API. I've decided to duplicate Pathauto Bulk Update but using the Batch API in order to bypass the limit you set for Pathauto Bulk Update. Mostly are based on the samples from the API reference and the Handbook.

For my .info file, I simply added the dependency for pathauto like so, dependencies[] = "pathauto".

For the .module file specifically the Batch API section, I have this:
&lt;?php
function pathauto_batch_form_submit($form, &amp;$form_state) {
  $batch = array(
    'title' =&gt; t('Generating Aliases'),

Someone advised me to login from the root shell by calling the command login. This then gave me the error message. I obviously didn't change my HOME directory correctly as it was pointing to /home/old_login and goes t...</p>

    <p>I first tried using the modules Short URL and Shorten URLs but I believe the module Short URL is currently on its early stages.

I've decided to create a custom module for our project but basing it on the modules above. Unfortunately, the module isn't an API like Short URL. It was a combination of both in which it provides a UI for shortening URLs and records them.

I started with how the module redirects the URLs when it encounters one from the record. The Short URL implemented the hookinit() to do this. This is somewhat what I was able to come up with based on the _Short URL__ module:

    <p>First off, you can probably check out this entry which provides four functions to look at upon developing. You would need the Devel module for this.

I personally use dsm though I believe it simply makes use of the dpm function from devel. I am not certain if this is the proper way of checking the available variables when theming. You could first take a look at the template files e.g. page.tpl.php or node.tpl.php to check what variables are available for you. I also sometimes add the code below to check for the available variables in a template file.

Zen


For many people, Zen is the ultimate starting theme for Drupal. If you are building your own standards-compliant theme, you will find it much easier to start with Zen than to start with Garland or Bluemarine. This theme has LOTs of documentation in the form of code comments for both the PHP (template.php) and HTML (page.tpl.php,...</p>

First, you would need to edit the template.php file of your Genesis subtheme and add the codes below. For the SUBTHEME_primary_links function, you'll need to copy the  theme_links function. You'll then need to make some slight modifications on the function.

    <p>I had a problem yesterday with my Archlinux installation. Everything was just going fine until I restarted my computer. Arch was trying to load the daemons and modules but can't seem to do it as there was an error saying "Read-only filesystem".

I was thinking to simply remount it after Arch gives me a prompt though it never did.

After some few research and inquiries in the #archlinux channel in Freenode, I was able to resolve this. The solution an arch user gave me:
