    <p>After setting up the basic install of my Jekyll site, I then migrated the posts of my current Drupal site over to Jekyll.</p>

<h2>Migrating Drupal Posts to Jekyll</h2>

<p>Migration was also easy as I only needed to follow <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Blog-Migrations">these steps</a>. I first installed the extensions <code>sequel</code> and <code>mysqlplus</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo gem install sequel mysqlplus</code></pre></div>

<p>After this, I downloaded a backup copy of the database of my current blog using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate">Backup and Migrate</a> and imported it to a newly created database. As far as I know, you would only actually need the tables <code>node</code> and <code>node_revisions</code>. My Drupal site has a prefix <code>drpl_</code> for its tables so I need to make some minor modifications on the migration script. If you are not aware if where the migration script exists, I was able to find it at <code>/var/lib/gems/1.8/gems/jekyll-0.11.2/lib/jekyll/migrators/drupal.rb</code>. I've prepended the tables with <code>drpl_</code>. You can also opt to use this <a href="http://drupal.org/node/403742">script</a> to remove the prefixes. The migration script also makes use of the <strong>System URL</strong> i.e. node/[nid]. I've read in other sites that the script messes up when nodes use an alias. What I did was that I deleted all aliases since the database I'm using is only a backup. I did <code>mysql -u user -p -e "TRUNCATE TABLE drpl_url_alias"</code> for this.</p>

<p>After preparing the script and removing the aliases, I executed the migration command from Jekyll's documentation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>ruby -rubygems -e <span class="s1">'require "jekyll/migrators/drupal"; Jekyll::Drupal.process("database", "user", "pass")'</span></code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll need to execute this on the root directory of your site which is <code>$HOME/dsdeiz.github.com/</code> for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the migration, the posts were created under the directory <code>_posts</code>. All I needed to do then was to just move them over to my subdirectory <code>blog</code>, added the variable <code>category: blog</code> for the <strong>YAML Front Matter</strong> on each post and made some changes on the posts for images, code highlighting and file attachments.</p>

<h2>Deploying the Site</h2>

<p>I've used Github's Pages feature to host the site. Deployment was also very easy as Github has documented it <a href="http://pages.github.com/">here</a>. I only followed the instructions and waited for a few minutes for the site to be published. For updating the site, I only needed to push the changes and new files over to my repo.</p>
