  <section class="post-content">
    <p>Recently, I encountered a project that requires rebuilding a site over and over in order to test recent changes. There were a bunch of scripts that did this automatically. The scripts were bash and PHP scripts. The bash scripts consist of calling <code>drush</code> commands such as <code>drush en</code>, <code>drush si</code> and <code>drush scr</code>. The PHP scripts task were to import content, terms, and probably set some configurations. These PHP scripts are also the ones ran through <code>drush scr</code>. I didn't go through each line of the scripts but I think what they basically do is enable modules, import contents from a data source, copy some files over to <code>sites/default/files</code> and install Drupal.</p>

<p>While all these are cool and all (and works perfectly), I thought that there might be a 'Drupal way' to do it. The first thing that came to my mind to automate all these is to use <a href="http://drupal.org/developing/distributions">Installation Profiles</a>. Basically, include all needed modules in the profile's <code>.info</code> file and do the importing on an added task.</p>

<p>These are the things I did:
1. Create sample content types and export these through features.
2. Export CSV files and images.
3. Create a migration class using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/migrate">Migrate</a> module.
4. Add a new task in the profile to process the import creating in the previous step.</p>

<p>The first step is simple. I created 3 content types namely <strong>Pants</strong>, <strong>Shirt</strong>, and <strong>Product</strong>. <strong>Pants</strong> and <strong>Shirts</strong> contain the fields <em>Image</em> (created automatically when using the <em>Standard</em> profile) and <em>Price</em>. The two content types also contain fields that are specific to each of them e.g. color for <strong>Shirt</strong> and size for <strong>Pants</strong>. <strong>Product</strong> content type has a multi-value field called <em>Items</em>. This field is an <a href="http://drupal.org/project/entityreference">entityreference</a> that accepts the bundles <strong>Pants</strong> and <strong>Shirt</strong>.</p>

<p>For the second step, I used <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_data_export">Views data export</a> to create the CSV export. I messed up the field names and values though so I had to modify each exported CSV file.</p>

<p>The third step is quite tricky since I don't use the Migrate module that much. It's quite powerful though. I created three migration classes - one for each content type. I had simple content types so the migration classes were a bit easy to create.</p>

<p>The fourth step is to create an installation profile. This was my first time creating one so I did some researches before proceeding. My <code>.install</code> file basically just calls <code>standard_install()</code>. It only contains this a <code>hook_install</code> implementation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="sd">/**</span>
<span class="sd"> * Implements hook_install().</span>
<span class="sd"> */</span>
<span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">myprofile_install</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// Do the installation from the Standard profile.</span>
  <span class="k">include_once</span> <span class="nx">DRUPAL_ROOT</span> <span class="o">.</span> <span class="s1">'/profiles/standard/standard.install'</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nx">standard_install</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I encountered a few issues with this one though. I removed a few core modules from my <code>.info</code> file which caused the installation to break. Probably it's best to review what exactly <code>standard_install()</code> contains other than just calling it.</p>

<p>I then added one task for importing the content. I was advised to checkout <a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart">Commerce Kickstart</a> distribution since it has a 'demo' task which does the importing. I simply just investigated what was defined in <code>commerce_kickstart_import_content()</code> and <code>migrate_ui_batch()</code>.</p>

<p>So yeah, that's just it. :D I did a few re-installation before I got the Installation Profile to work. This works for simple tasks though I'm not sure how well it would when it comes to a large Drupal application. You can download the profile <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8eaemxweacygg7k/myprofile.tar.gz?dl=1">here</a>. Boom! 8-)</p>
